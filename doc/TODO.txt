default page should be new appt. page instead of index?
** Rob: This sounds like the default page should have some of that "info" stuff from above.

write specs to pull information for appointments
** Rob: I already added a basic listing (if you are a logged in user)

- fonts

set up users in app (see Pat for who needs an account)
** Rob: Pat can set them up herself! Go to the /signup link and the first user created (Pat?) becomes the admin.

ability to maintain users
- add/remove
** Rob: Yup. got that
- enable/disable?
** Rob:  I can get this, too, if you tell me how you'd like it to behave.

write specs to pull information for appointments 

allow a person to enter their contact info only once but enter info for multiple pets
- need to extract a pet model
- appt. has many pets, pet belongs to appointment
- appt. accepts nested attributes for pets
- if a person adds too many sections for pets, he should be able to remove them
