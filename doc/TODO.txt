Some of these are more important to Pat than others. Some we can finish at GiveCamp, and some we cannot.
They are in no particular order or grouping. Whatever you decide to tackle, communicate about it so we
don't duplicate effort.

have an about page?
- contact info
- non-profit status

show phone number prominently so that people can also call

how do we integrate, if at all, with http://www.csnip.org/ ?
skin the website to look like c-snip or add a iframe to c-snip website.

default page should be new appt. page instead of index?
** Rob: This sounds like the default page should have some of that "info" stuff from above.

write specs to pull information for appointments
** Rob: I already added a basic listing (if you are a logged in user)

consistent style
- foot in same place on all pages
** Rob: there were some #footer styles in the old public/stylesheets/screen.css that did this

- fonts

set up users in app (see Pat for who needs an account)
** Rob: Pat can set them up herself! Go to the /signup link and the first user created (Pat?) becomes the admin.

ability to maintain users
- add/remove
** Rob: Yup. got that
- enable/disable?
** Rob:  I can get this, too, if you tell me how you'd like it to behave.

write specs to pull information for appointments 

allow a person to enter their contact info only once but enter info for multiple pets
- need to extract a pet model
- appt. has many pets, pet belongs to appointment
- appt. accepts nested attributes for pets
- if a person adds too many sections for pets, he should be able to remove them
