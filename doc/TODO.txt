Some of these are more important to Pat than others. Some we can finish at GiveCamp, and some we cannot.
They are in no particular order or grouping. Whatever you decide to tackle, communicate about it so we
don't duplicate effort.

have an about page?
- contact info
- non-profit status

show phone number prominently so that people can also call

how do we integrate, if at all, with http://www.csnip.org/ ?
skin the website to look like c-snip or add a iframe to c-snip website.

default page should be new appt. page instead of index?

write specs to pull information for appointments

consistent style
- foot in same place on all pages
- fonts

set up users in app (see Pat for who needs an account)

ability to maintain users
- add/remove

write specs to pull information for appointments 

allow a person to enter their contact info only once but enter info for multiple pets
- need to extract a pet model
- appt. has many pets, pet belongs to appointment
- appt. accepts nested attributes for pets
- if a person adds too many sections for pets, he should be able to remove them
