TODO: 

cleanup fieldWithErrors when the form renders with errors
=======
Some of these are more important to Pat than others. Some we can finish at GiveCamp, and some we cannot.
They are in no particular order or grouping. Whatever you decide to tackle, communicate about it so we
don't duplicate effort.

have an about page?
- contact info
- non-profit status

show phone number prominently so that people can also call

how do we integrate, if at all, with http://www.csnip.org/ ?

default page should be new appt. page instead of index?

style a notes class

show cat- and dog-specific fields when clicking Cat/Dog radio buttons
- add for_dog and for_cat class to form
- CSS should do the rest

skin the website to look like c-snip or add a iframe to c-snip website.

write specs to pull information for appointments

consistent style
- foot in same place on all pages
- fonts

ensure new appt. form looks good when there are validation errors

set up users in app (see Pat for who needs an account)

ability to maintain users
- add/remove
- enable/disable?

store years owned and months owned instead of a free text value
- will allow future mining of ownership data

hair length could be presented as a radio button group for Short, Medium, Long

only collect veterinarian name instead of also asking if your pet has visited a vet.

<<<<<<< HEAD
write specs to pull information for appointments 
=======
allow a person to enter their contact info only once but enter info for multiple pets
- need to extract a pet model
- appt. has many pets, pet belongs to appointment
- appt. accepts nested attributes for pets
- if a person adds too many sections for pets, he should be able to remove them
